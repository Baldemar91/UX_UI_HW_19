                        <p>
                           In order to understand our target users a bit more, we spoke with college students about cost of educational resources they currently utilize or have utilized in the past. We learned about 53% of recent graduates are unemployed. The average amount of student debt upon college graduation is over $25,000. Currently educational resources are overpriced and not affordable by the average college student.

                        <p>
                            To get an even deeper understanding of our users we distributed an online survey, created a user testing plan and conducted five one on one user interviews. We synthesized user key insights into categories then created an affinity diagram to translate our users insights into legible qualitative data.

                        Most of our feedback consisted of affordability, accessibility and live support. This brought up the idea of making Squad Ed a more unique experience by incorporating one on one live mentor guidance. With an accessible live mentor users would feel more confident in pursuing the courses they need through Squad Ed.

                        We reviewed our competitors and discovered a lack in live support, mentor guidance, and affordability. Although our competitors are transitioning in recruiting more certified instructors most of the courses taught are by professionals who currently work in their field of study.

                    <p>
                        From the data we collected, we created an ideal user flow as how we imagined our website to pan out and what our desired user experience would entail.</p>

                        It later developed into a storyboard, which captured the userâ€™s journey and emotional results with each page they interacted with. From here we could decide what features were needed to make Squad Ed a unique experience. We wanted to create a seamless experience for our target users by emphasizing on simplicity but keeping a balance between affordability and accessibility, as both were appreciated.

                        We conducted six in-person user testing sessions to identify usability issues and analyze how users interact with our current prototype. We found that our target users would like an English to Spanish translate option, recognizable icons to easily navigate through the website and easy to read labelling.

                            The latest design of S.A FoodBank alleviates user roadblocks with an English to Spanish toggle feature and highlights user accessibility options in bolder tones. We incorporated intuitive UI elements that are recognizable by current and new users. We wanted our users to quickly access food assistance programs, volunteer work and donate.

                            In order to immediately catch the attention of our users, we designed info cards on the homepage with broad topics that would make it easier and more encouraging for users to get help, contribute and volunteer bridging both the organization and user needs. We also included a live video chat feature for both mobile and desktop websites to speak with an S.A. Food Bank representative to receive the assistance users need.

                            It was important that we made the food assistance process more simple and efficient since our research revealed that many users lack the ability to access help. To address this barrier, we designed an English to Spanish toggle feature where users can click to toggle on the Spanish translate option. The idea behind redesigning the S.A. Food Bank website was to simplify user interactions by giving prominence to resources for users in need. We focused on features that are highly intuitive and can evolve over time based on future user testing.
